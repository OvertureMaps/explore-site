# [1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2)
#### 2024-Aug-28

Many thanks to [@eti7075] for all his hard work on the site during the summer! 

#### :tada:New Features
* [#133] [#108] [#129] The theme selector control now has themes *and* types, with the ability to enable/disable and pin/unpin each. Pinning a theme or type accentuates its styling to make it easier to see.
* [#131] We've made a complete style pass, adjusting colors and color saturation of map entities to make things look a lot less 'busy'. 
* [#89] We added a new Navigator control that allows the user to visit several places on the globe, with different theme styling as appropriate for each place of interest. 
* [#147] We've updated the data to show the 2024-08-20 release

#### :bug: Bugfixes:
  * [#92] The geoparquet data release has been fixed to include some missing building:part ways in NYC
  * [#114] Added a close button to the download disablement pop-up
  * [#111] Updated the intro/guided tour to explain the new 'pin' functionality 
  * [#105] Added a 'beta' label to the site header
  * [#150],[#147] Adjusted the case of GitHub in tour tooltips
