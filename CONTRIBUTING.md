## Forking, cloning, and running io-site
This section suggests a toolset and method to start contributing to io-site. However, you are welcome to use your own tools for the job. Here's what you could use:

| Tool | Suggestion | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| üü© Node version manager | [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) | [fish](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish), [n](https://github.com/tj/n), [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) |
| üìù Text editor | [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) |
| üßë‚Äçüíª POSIX-compliant CLI | [Bash for Linux](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) | [WSL for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), [Zsh the OSX default](https://www.zsh.org/) |
| üåê Web browser | [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) |

### Setting up io-site locally
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository from [OvertureMaps/io-site](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site) to your own GitHub account.
2. [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) with `git clone https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site.git`.
3. From the CLI, open your freshly cloned io-site directory by running the command `code io-site`
4. Once in VSCode, type **Ctrl+Shift+`** to open a terminal. Alternatively, use the **Terminal>New Terminal** menu option.
5. Make sure you are using [the latest `node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) by running `node --version`. If not, then running `nvm install node` will set it up for you.
6. Install all required dependencies with `npm install`
7. Then run `npm run all` to set up io-site.
8. Finally, run `npm run dev` to start the server on port 5173.

Congrats! üéâ You should now be able to use io-site by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) on Chrome. It is also possible to open a new window with `o + enter` via the terminal the io-site is running in.

### Setting up the VSCode debugger
VSCode provides a debugging mode using Chrome. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Run>Add Configuration** and select `{} Chrome: Launch`
2. This will create `launch.json`.
3. Make sure to add the `/site/` path to `webRoot` and change `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` on `url`, so that the file looks like this:
```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/site/"
        }
    ]
}
```

Great! You should now be able to run the io-site server with `npm run dev` and then the debugger by either pressing **F5** on your keyboard, or clicking on **Run>Start Debugging**.

This will launch Chrome on whatever address you provided to `url` on `launch.json`, allowing you to use io-site as well as entering debugging mode on VSCode.

> **Note:** Again, you are welcome to try your own debugging method, such as [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/).


## Directory structure

Now that you know how to set up, run and debug io-site, you will probably want a tour of the directory structure. This should help you know where to add any new features, or where to spot a particular bug in need of fixing.

Here are the relevant parts of the directory tree along with short descriptions of each directory:

- `.github/workflows`: Contains the build and deploy workflows for the project.
- `site`: The 'site' directory is the heart of the codebase, housing the majority of substantial code. Subdirectories include:
    - `public`: This contains shared images and vector files that are shared sitewide.
    - `scripts`: The home for general purpose scripts, such as 'deploy'.
    - `src`: Webpage code is stored here. Currently, styling and functional code are stored in the same directory, using the practice of `FILENAME.jsx` and `FILENAME.css`. Subdirectories include:
        - `nav`: Contains the navigational components of the io-site which can be seen at the top of the web page. Similarly, styling and functionality files are kept in the same location, with only file endings differing in naming.

## Submit a Pull Request

To push your changes you will have to [submit a PR from your Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

> **‚ö†Ô∏è A Note of Caution**: io-site is a live code base! Please remember to continuously [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) and [synchronize those changes from VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20Synchronize%20Changes,commits%20to%20the%20upstream%20branch.) as you work in your local environment. You may also [rebase your main branch](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-02-03-more-ways-to-keep-your-pull-request-branch-up-to-date/) as you push commits to your PR.
